# Cryptocurrency Sentiment Analysis: Project Requirements

## Project Overview
This project will develop a cryptocurrency sentiment analysis application that analyzes Telegram chat data to identify sentiment trends. The implementation will fulfill all required technical components for the analytics application project.

## Core Requirements

### Analytics Application Components
1. **Source Code Management**
   - All code stored and versioned in GitHub repository
   - Well-organized repository structure with documentation

2. **Continuous Deployment**
   - GitHub Actions workflow implementation
   - Automated testing, building, and deployment
   - Deployment status notifications

3. **Data Storage**
   - Telegram chat data stored in Amazon Redshift
   - Appropriate schema design for sentiment analysis data
   - ETL pipeline for data processing

4. **Machine Learning**
   - Sentiment analysis model developed in AWS SageMaker
   - Model trained on cryptocurrency-related text data
   - Endpoint deployed for real-time inference
   - JSON request/response format for predictions

5. **Monitoring**
   - Prometheus installed for metrics collection
   - Grafana dashboards for visualization
   - Alert configurations for critical metrics
   - Application and infrastructure monitoring

6. **API Service**
   - REST API deployed on Amazon Elastic Beanstalk
   - Endpoints that accept and return JSON payloads
   - Documentation for API endpoints
   - Connection to SageMaker for predictions

7. **AWS Deployment**
   - All components deployed within AWS ecosystem
   - Appropriate networking configuration
   - Service integration (SageMaker, Redshift)
   - Application running in Docker containers on EC2 instance

## Assessment Criteria Implementation

### Machine Learning
1. **ML Inference**
   - SageMaker endpoint that performs sentiment analysis
   - Inference available via API calls
   - Appropriate model performance metrics

2. **Functional Predictions**
   - Sentiment classification (positive/negative/neutral)
   - Confidence scores for predictions
   - Consistent and reliable response format

### DevOps
1. **Environment Separation**
   - Development environment for testing
   - Production environment for deployment
   - Configuration management for environments

2. **Monitoring and Alerts**
   - Comprehensive metrics collection
   - Visual dashboards for key performance indicators
   - Configured alerting thresholds
   - System health monitoring

### Data
1. **Datastore Implementation**
   - Amazon Redshift properly configured
   - Efficient schema design
   - Data validation and integrity checks
   - Query optimization for analytics

### Security
1. **Least Privilege Principle**
   - IAM roles with minimal required permissions
   - Security groups with restricted access
   - Service-specific credentials
   - Role-based access control

2. **Data Encryption**
   - TLS encryption for all API endpoints
   - Secure connections to database
   - Encrypted data transfer between services
   - HTTPS implementation

### Overall Quality
1. **Source Code Quality**
   - Clean, well-documented code
   - Consistent coding standards
   - Error handling implementation
   - Code reusability and modularity

2. **Architecture Design**
   - Well-defined component interaction
   - Scalable service design
   - Logical data flow
   - Service decoupling where appropriate

3. **Functionality**
   - End-to-end working application
   - Reliable prediction service
   - Responsive API
   - Comprehensive monitoring

## Implementation Plan
